# MinionAH Backend Optimizations Fork

## 🚀 Overview
This fork contains comprehensive backend optimizations for the MinionAH project, focusing on security, performance, and code quality improvements.

## 🔧 What's Been Improved

### Security Enhancements
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Added input validation and sanitization for all database operations
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Increased session token entropy (32 bytes) and improved session management
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all API endpoints and user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented basic rate limiting to prevent API abuse

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Indexes**: Added performance indexes for `timeCreated` and `createdAt` fields
- **API Caching**: 5-minute cache for external API calls to reduce redundant requests
- **Batch Operations**: Enhanced database utilities for better throughput
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to prevent cascading failures

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Centralized Utilities**: Created `api-utils.ts` for standardized error handling and responses
- **Better Documentation**: Added JSDoc comments and comprehensive documentation
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript types and null safety
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into reusable utility functions

## 📁 Key Files Modified

1. **`prisma/schema.prisma`** - Added performance indexes
2. **`src/lib/server/api-utils.ts`** - New centralized API utilities
3. **`src/lib/server/lucia/auth.ts`** - Enhanced authentication system
4. **`src/routes/api/craftcost/[[internalName]]/+server.ts`** - Refactored with caching and rate limiting
5. **`src/lib/server/utilities.ts`** - Enhanced database utilities with security features
6. **`BACKEND_OPTIMIZATIONS_SUMMARY.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
