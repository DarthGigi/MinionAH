# 🏦 MinionAH

MinionAH is a seamless and easy-to-use way to purchase and sell Hypixel SkyBlock minions with a beautiful interface. It's designed with precision and a good user experience in mind and is perfect for _any_ SkyBlock player.

MinionAH makes it easy to sell minions and view information about minions at a glance.

## 🏠 Home

![MinionAH](/static/assets/images/readme/overview.png)
As shown, it's easy to find minions on MinionAH. But it gets even better, when you hover over a minion or a user, more info about them will show up. Clicking the user will open their profile. Clicking the minion will open the wiki page of the minion for even more information.

## 👤 Profile

After signing up with [mc-auth](https://mc-auth.com), you can access your profile page where you can create a new minion listing, see a list of your minions, and delete minions you sold or no longer want to sell.

## 🛠️ Creating Minions

Creating minions is very easy. You simply select a minion from the minion dropdown or just start typing the name of the minion. Next, select the tier and fill in how many minions you're selling and the price (for each). Finally, just click Create and you're done!

## 💰 Purchasing Minions

The way you buy minions is essentially the same as if you would be using Discord servers to sell your minions.  
You simply message the user who sells the minion and discuss when you both can get online and trade.

# 🤔 Why MinionAH

I (Gigi) made MinionAH because (at the time of writing) you can't sell Minions in the in-game Auction House. Instead, you need to join various Discord servers and post "ad" messages in the right channels or the in-game chat. In both cases, the message also "disappears" since so many others are doing the same thing.  
That's why I thought, "There must surely be a better way to tackle this problem." So I decided to work on MinionAH.
